I'm Jihun.
My best friend is Minsu.
Minsu and I love rock music.
We are members of the school band Rock It.
I play the guitar, and Minsu plays the drums.
We are not good players, but we have so much fun together.
With Minsu, I laugh all the time. Together, we are happy.
I'm Hannah.
Mrs. Schmidt, my neighbor, is a dear friend to me.
She is a great listener, and I often talk with her.
She doesn't talk much.
She just nods and smiles at me.
Sometimes I'm sad, and she bakes a cake for me.
Her cake is yummy, and I feel all right, like magic.
With Mrs. Schmidt, I feel at home.
Together, we are happy.
I'm Tim.
Hope is my guide dog and my best friend.
She is by my side 24/7.
She even goes to school with me.
Is she a good student?
Well, she mostly sleeps in class, but the teachers don't mind.
On weekends, we go to the park and play together.
With Hope, I feel free and strong.
Together, we are happy
